1. Introduction
  This report is for CS2302 Lab1. There are four questions and 
  each of them requires to generate three figures using recursion.
  
2. Proposed solution design and implementation
  The solution consists of two parts. The first part is to create
  a list which store x- and y- coordinations of expected figure to
  draw. The second part


3. Experimental results


4. Conclusion
